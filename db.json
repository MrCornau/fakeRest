Think of people being -----> camera !!!  shy or just wanting to remain their privacy online, while still wanting to make commentary videos on YouTube, for example. Like those Anime VTubers do. Where do you see this going the next decade? Do you think in 2030, you’ll be able to do the the thing I mentioned? In 8-9 years, a lot can happen, just look at smartphones. This tech could revolutionize entertainment on all platforms and make it possible to express yourself in ways never possible before.",
