      "content": "Camera far reaching lens with computer interface /!/ Hello! I have an EOS M100 (15-45mm lens) and am very happy with the camera. I have used it for quite a bit, but mostly on automatic mode. I am learning to explore some of the settings in manual mode and slowly getting better. Here is a pic I took a while ago playing around with a tea cup\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ecwg5bfip6z41.png?width=1277&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b190ea5982ef27ec91261f53b33b06f903c5d6cb\n\nMy new obsession is not tea cups but trains and the graffiti on them. I have taken the following picture the other day of the train rolling through the city that is approx 360 meters away (45mm focal):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7wjt2n2dp6z41.png?width=1276&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11836c6b4409f2ee167795c93e07d6e5f3929366\n\nand zoomed in (of previous image) on the train cart:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wd7q3dm8d6z41.png?width=1187&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa58ecc70c9f1c65bf6310ff67d91b65fd69c2e8\n\nThe resolution is good but I want much better. Say something like this(but perhaps better ) i found on google:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://i.pinimg.com/originals/64/3b/f7/643bf7a25d579ba70e6b3dc96a7e1206.jpg](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/64/3b/f7/643bf7a25d579ba70e6b3dc96a7e1206.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(ignore the messaging on it)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to be able to read the text on the cart and detailed picture of the grafitti. I could buy an additional lense for the EOS M100 as listed here ([https://travelfornoobs.com/best-lenses-for-canon-eos-m100/](https://travelfornoobs.com/best-lenses-for-canon-eos-m100/))  - in the 200mm range (will this be sufficient for my desired resolution?). However, the EOS M100 is not the best in my opinion in terms of software for my project.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor my project I am looking to document and classify train graffiti. Perhaps I will identify various styles or artists...or whatever discovery I make -  I am not sure yet. Perhaps I will just make a big poster with composed of many train shots and gift it to a friend. I feel like I am exploring an ancient language in a Egyptian pyramid and do not know where the exploration will take me but I am very excited of all the possibilities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have lots of trains rolling in on this bridge and I am considering setting up two cameras. The first camera would be a very primitive camera with the purpose of identifying moving trains (this would be done with some sort of -----> machine learning !!!  type approach - I have never done something like this, but have enough experience in programming to tackle such a project and know that it is possible. For this camera I will use something cheap - my 8megapixel phone camera seems to be okay for this for picking up movement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first camera will identify when the trains are rolling in (there are like 20 minutes breaks in between) and based on the computed speed of train the second camera will take picture of each train cart while it is on the clear shot area of the bridge. The images will then be transferred to a computer for post processing of some sort.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy EOS m100 is not the best candidate for the second camera (assuming I had an appropriate lens). It is difficult to automate picture taking. I have done a rough test - eos m100 has a cell phone app provided by canon that is capable of taking pictures remotely through the cell phone on screen press. This can be hooked up to a laptop that just automates the pressing of a cellphone screen in order to take pictures ([https://www.rightpoint.com/rplabs/automating-input-events-abd-keyevent](https://www.rightpoint.com/rplabs/automating-input-events-abd-keyevent)) - the laptop can hypothetically use camera one's machine learning data to automate the press when required. However, after basic trials I am not sure I can really specify the image taking rate based  on different train speed (they don't go too fast so it is not the biggest concern but getting consistent shots of train carts on the exact same part of the bridge would be nice). The EOS sometimes needs to refocus between pictures and I don't think I can get too precise with the picture taking rate. For constant power I could buy something like this ([https://www.amazon.com/Glorich-ACK-E12-Replacement-Adapter-Mirrorless/dp/B00VNSD7LW](https://www.amazon.com/Glorich-ACK-E12-Replacement-Adapter-Mirrorless/dp/B00VNSD7LW)). In addition, it is difficult to extract images from the EOS m100 live without taking out the sd card and exiting the canon remote picture taking app which would require physical interference and not be able to allow my camera two to take pictures for many days at a time (I would like to take pictures for a few weeks minimum).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy question to you guys:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat general lens do you recommend for getting the resolution that I desire?\n\nWhat camera core body (without the lens) do you recommend that could provide more effective interface with my computer for automated picture taking and image downloads while still being powered on for days on end?\n\nPerhaps I could combine the two questions together for a camera/lens combo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy budget is in Canadian. I want to hear all recommendations, I can  squeeze 1000-2000 dollars, but if it is a really good camera I can view it is an investment for future.",

The exposures on the Sony see better. The Sony makes all around better photos, of course BUT the Google Pixel 3 2/3\" camera with a tiny let's that is just an add on to a cell phone,  is pretty amazingly close to the quality of the full frame mirrorless camera.\n\nI think this is insane to see.\n\n\nThis makes me excited to see what the hell the future of photography will be like when they add this kind of software to the quality optics of a real camera.

Luminar claims to adjust yo your style so I suppose it could cut down on work needed to get images to have the same feel as others in a set.  \n\n\nThe part of me that loves browsing other peoples work and seeing the personality of each photographer conveyed in their images is worried that this trend will lead to a loss of personal style in images which we already see on platforms like Instagram where you can brows thousands of profiles and see the same colours, the same deep dark greens, and whatever else is trendy at the moment. I do really enjoy the images, but it feels to me like the art of photography is getting lost with more and more tools that promote AI or generic filters and presets that so many people use and leave.  \nI also understand that these tools can help get to a decent starting point for editing but then the editor/photographer can adjust them to make it their own with a bit less effort.  \n\n\nThe other part of me that likes an easy and efficient process sees it as a great way to help professionals cut down on post processing work and help in other aspects of their workflow.  \n\n\nI see the benefit of such tools but I also feel like it could lead to a place where AI will just generate images and people will be passing it off as their work because they pressed a button.  \n\n\nI also know many people will use these tools to help them improve or be more efficient, and probably a large amount of people will not use tools like this because they find joy in making every adjustment or setting reflect their vision for the viewers.  \n\n\nAnyway, what are your thoughts on tools like this and the general trend we are seeing of more and more tools appearing?",

It just saves a jpg (80% compression) copy of current image (if saved is selected) next to the original RAW (not all formats supported jet!)\n\nThe program actually **doesn't delete** any of your photos, but rather moves them into one of the subfolders: \"/save\", \"/delete\" or \"/autodeleted\"\n\nPlease let me know if you find a bug, have features that you'd want me to add or just if you liked it!\n\nHope that I can help some of you to finally take on the massive task of decluttering your hard drive from bad photos =)",

      "content": "Any good -----> Ai !!!  photo organizers? /!/ Hello! I have tens of thousands of photos in my external hard drive and some of them in my PC. (win 10)  I realized that It's very huge job to find the one I am looking for.  \n   \nSo I figured out that to find the photo I am looking for, I would need to have some sort of an artificial intelligent tool that will tag all the photos automatically for me based on what's in the photo.   \n\n\nHowever, there is only few of those and I have no idea what would actually be good. I bet some of you have experiences of those, so please, if you can help me, it would be very helpful! :)",
